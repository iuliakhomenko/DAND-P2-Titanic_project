### Overview

This project is focused on exploring [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and investigating the main factors that influence chances of Titanic passengers survival.

All data wrangling and analysis for this project was performed in Python, applying most common data science libraries.

The project consists of four logical parts :

- Data overview : understanding the available data and posing question for invetsigation, dividing it into several smaller subquestions;

- Data Wrangling : using pandas library to clean available data, fill in missing values and create new features to facilitate the analysis;

- Data Exploration : using pandas and Python data visualization libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn to define the main 
trends in data and answer the questions posed at the Data Overview phase, visualizing data with histograms, boxplots and
scatterplots to uncover the underlying relationships in data and performing statistical tests to varify them;

- Drawing Conclusions : communicating findings, summarising the main factors that increase the survival chances for Titanic
passnegers during the crush.
